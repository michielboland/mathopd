Keyword: AcceptMulti
Where:   Tuning
Type:    Flag
Default: On
Desc:    By default, Mathopd will try to accept more connections
         after it has accepted one, until the accept call indicates
         a blocking condition. When there is hardly any traffic,
         this means that an extra system call is made each time
         a connection comes in. If you don't want that behaviour,
         use this keyword to turn it off.

Keyword: Address
Where:   Server
Type:    Address
Default: 0 (any address)
Desc:    If you want a server to listen on a specific address, rather
         than any address, use this keyword.
         Example:

           Server {
             Address 127.0.0.1
           }

Keyword: Admin
Where:   Control
Type:    String
Default: (none)
Desc:    The value of this keyword, if set, is displayed in HTTP error
         messages.

Keyword: Alias
Where:   Control
Type:    String
Desc:    Control blocks that contain an Alias keyword are used in
         URI-to-path translation. A block with an Alias keyword must
         have one or more Location keywords as well. Generally
         speaking, Mathopd scans Control blocks until it can match
         the directory part of the Request-URI with the alias.
         Scanning starts in the Virtual server and continues
         upwards. Scanning stops as soon as a match is found.

         Example:

           Control {
             Alias /
             Location /usr/share/doc/handbook
           }
           Control {
             Alias /boland
             Location /usr/home/boland/www
           }

         The above is an example of two aliases. Note that the order
         of the aliases matters: if you switch the two around, unexpected
         things will happen (the more specific alias will be obscured by
         the '/' alias.)

Keyword: AllowDotfiles
Where:   Control
Type:    Flag
Default: Off
Desc:    Normally, Mathopd will not serve any file if any part of its
         pathname contains '/.', for security reasons.
         If the AllowDotFiles flag is set, there restrictions are lifted
         a bit, although constructions like '/./', '/../', etc. are
         still disallowed.

Keyword: AnyHost
Where:   Virtual
Desc:    If a virtual server has this keyword, it will match on any Host:
         header that is sent by the client. Other virtual servers that have
         an explicit Host name are still checked, so the 'AnyHost' virtual
         server will only be used as a last resort. See also the discussion
         of wildcard expansion under the 'Location' keyword.

Keyword: AutoIndexCommand
Where:   Control
Desc:    If a request for a directory is made, and none of the files
         specified by IndexNames is found in that directory, mathopd will,
         as a last resort, run a special CGI script to generate a directory
         listing. The AutoIndexCommand determines which script exactly.
         The script must be an absolute pathname.

Keyword: Backlog
Where:   Server
Type:    Integer
Default: 128
Desc:    If all connections are in use, and there are no idle connections,
         Mathopd will make no attempt to accept new connections. The
         operating system may hold on to new connections though, in which
         case they will be picked up by Mathopd as soon as one connection
         becomes idle. The number of connections that can 'hang in the air'
         in this fashion is determined by the Backlog parameter.
         Normally one should never have to change this number.

Keyword: BufSize
Where:   Tuning
Type:    Integer
Default: 12288
Desc:    The server uses two buffers to store incoming and outgoing data.
         The size of the outgoing buffer is determined by the value of the
         BufSize keyword.
         Larger buffers can lead to less system calls, but also increase the
         amount of memory used by the server process.

         Note: if you run a version of Mathopd that uses sendfile(), the
         default bufsize is way too large, and you should decrease it.

Keyword: BytesRead
Where:   LogFormat
Desc:    The number of octets (bytes) read from the client during a single
         request.

Keyword: BytesWritten
Where:   LogFormat
Desc:    The number of octets (bytes) sent to the client during a single
         request.
         Note that this number may not be accurate in all cases.
         If a network error occurs after a successful send operation,
         the logged number of bytes sent will be too big.

Keyword: ChildLog
Where:   Control
Type:    String
Desc:    If a child process, such as a CGI script, writes a message to its
         standard error file descriptor (fd 2) it will end up in the file
         designated by the ChildLog keyword. If no ChildLog is specified,
         diagnostic messages will be thrown away.

Keyword: Clobber
Where:   Tuning
Type:    Flag
Default: On
Desc:    Normally, Mathopd closes connections that are idle when a new
         connection arrives and the maximum number of connections has been
         reached. This behaviour is called 'clobbering'. By setting the
         'Clobber' flag to 'Off', new connections cannot be made until an
         existing connection terminates by itself or times out.

Keyword: ContentLength
Where:   LogFormat
Desc:    The total size of the resource requested by the client.

Keyword: Control
Where:   Global, Server, Virtual
Type:    Block
Desc:    The 'Control' keyword starts a so-called control block. As the name
         suggests, it controls the behaviour of the server. In fact the
         keyword itself does not do very much; the directives inside the
         control block do all the work.

         Unless the block contains an Alias directive, settings that are
         specified inside a control block are inherited by all next blocks
         that are on an equal or lower level.

         Control blocks can appear at three different levels. Control bocks
         that appear at the 'top' level in the configuration file are called
         global control blocks. Next, one can put control blocks inside
         Server blocks. The settings defined there are local to that specific
         server. And finally one can have control blocks inside Virtual
         blocks. These blocks are on the lowest level.

         Usually a configuration file is made up of one very large global
         control block, followed by a bunch of Virtual servers that each
         contain a small control block, mostly containing just an Alias and
         a Location directive.

Keyword: CoreDirectory
Where:   Global
Type:    String
Desc:    Normally, for practical reasons, the server changes its current
         directory to the root directory "/". If this is undesirable for
         whatever reason, you can specify an alternate directory here.
         As a side effect, if mathopd dumps core for whatever reason, the
         core file will be in this directory. Actually if the server is
         started by root it will never dump core for security reasons, so
         this feature is a bit useless.

Keyword: Ctime
Where:   LogFormat
Desc:    The current time in 'C' format (e.g. Sun Mar 30 21:44:52 2003.)

Keyword: EncryptedUserFile
Where:   Control
Type:    Flag
Default: Off
Desc:    Normally, the UserFile (see the descriptions of the Realm and
         Userfile keywords) contains passwords in clear-text format. If
         you want to use encrypted passwords (for example, using the
         'htpasswd' program) you must set the value of EncryptedUserFile
         to 'On' in the control block that contains the UserFile in
         question.

Keyword: Error401File
Where:   Control
Type:    String
Desc:    The contents of this file will be displayed whenever a '401' (not
         authorized) error occurs. The file may be a CGI script or an
         external command. If CGI scripts are used, the script is responsible
         for sending the proper status code.

Keyword: Error403File
Where:   Control
Type:    String
         The contents of this file will be displayed whenever a '403'
         (forbidden) error occurs. For more information, see Error401File.

Keyword: Error404File
Where:   Control
Type:    String
         The contents of this file will be displayed whenever a '404' (not
         found) error occurs. For more information, see Error401File.

Keyword: ErrorLog
Where:   Global
Type:    String
Desc:    The server process will print diagnostics messages into this file.
         Mathopd will open the error log in write-only mode. If it does not
         have permission to do that, the program will exit.
         Note that if the value of ErrorLog contains a percent sign (%),
         the name of the error logfile will be expanded using a strftime-like
         contruction (see also: Log.)

Keyword: ExactMatch
Where:   Control
Type:    Flag
Desc:    The ExactMatch causes an Alias to be used only if it matches the
         request-URI exactly. This is rather a hack. It was originally
         designed to disallow users more than one html page per web site.
         The way this is done is as follows

           Control {
             IndexNames { index.html }
             Types {
               text/html { html htm }
             }
           }
           Server {
             Virtual {
               Host www.another.example
               Control {
                 Alias /
                 Location /var/www/www.another.example
                 Specials {
                   Dummy { html htm }
                 }
               }
               Control {
                 Alias /
                 Location /var/www/www.another.example
                 ExactMatch On
               }
             }
             # other virtual servers ...
           }

         Now if someone requests http://www.another.example/, the alias
         will match exactly, so the control block at the bottom will be
         in effect. On the other hand, if a request is made for, say,
         http://www.another.example/foo.html, the alias will not match
         exactly, so the second control block from the bottom will be used.
         This control block overrides the type declaration for html and htm
         extensions, effectively hiding these files, even if they were to
         exist physically. Note that files with extensions other than html
         and htm are processed normally, so that you can for example still
         have things like images on your home page.

Keyword: ExpireInterval
Where:   Control
Type:    Integer
Desc:    If the value of ExpireInterval is nonzero (which is the default)
         the server will send an Expires: header that points to a data that
         is the specified number of seconds in the future.

Keyword: Export
Where:   Control
Type:    Block
Desc:    Some operating systems require that some environment variables
         have certain values in order for child processes to work correctly.
         To export these variables to child processes, use the 'Export'
         keyword. If you want to export certain variables with preset values,
         use 'PutEnv' instead.
         Example:

           Control {
             Export { TZ LD_LIBRARY_PATH }
           }

Keyword: External
Where:   Control
Type:    Block
Desc:    The 'External' keywords defines a set of filename extensions that
         get special treatment. (See also: Types, Specials.) If mathopd
         processes a filename whose extension is match in an 'External'
         block, it will run an external program with the name of the file
         as its first argument. Before execution, mathopd will change its
         current directory to the directory that contains the file that is
         being served.
         Example:

           Control {
             External {
               /usr/bin/perl { .pl }
             }
           }

         This will treat all files that end with '.pl' as CGI scripts,
         interpreted by /usr/bin/perl.

         It is possible to pass additional arguments to interpreters.
         For example, if you want to run all perl scripts with the '-T'
         option, use the following construction:

           Control {
             External {
               "/usr/bin/perl -T" { .pl }
             }
           }

Keyword: ExtraHeaders
Where:   Control
Type:    Block
Desc:    Use this keyword to add extra HTTP headers. This is perhaps best
         demonstrated by an example.

           Control {
             ExtraHeaders { "Cache-Control: max-age=3600" }
           }

         If this is done, all responses, well, to be precise, all responses
         with status code 200, will be accompanied by a

           Cache-Control: max-age=3600

         HTTP header.

Keyword: Family
Where:   Server
Type:    String
Desc:    The value of 'Family' determines the address family used by the
         server. If this parameter is not set, the address family is left
         unspecified. If set, the value must be either "inet" for IPv4 or
         "inet6" for IPv6. Note that inet6 servers may or may not listen
         on IPv4 addresses as well, depending on the operating system.
         See also the discussion of "v6only" at the Options keyword.

Keyword: Greedy
Where:   Tuning
Type:    Flag
Default: On

Keyword: Host
Where:   Virtual
Type:    String
Desc:    A virtual server has zero or more names. To name a virtual server,
         use the 'Host' keyword. More than one `Host' keyword is allowed
         for each virtual server.

Keyword: IndexNames
Where:   Control
Type:    Block
Desc:    Any request that ends with a slash ('/') is treated as an `index'.
         The terminology is a bit confusing, since no indexes are actually
         being made. What happens is that mathopd will map the request-URI
         to a directory. This directory is then scanned for a set of files
         called indexes. (For instance 'index.html'). As soon as a file is
         found, that file will be sent to the client.
         Example:

           Control {
             IndexNames { index.html Default.htm }
           }

         Note that the value of 'IndexNames' is carried over into all
         subsequent control blocks. That is, if you define IndexNames once
         it is not possible to reset its value later on.

Keyword: InputBufSize
Where:   Tuning
Type:    Integer
Default: 2048
Desc:    The input buffer contains the complete set of headers sent by the
         client. As such, it needs to be large enough to contain all those
         headers. Usually the default value of 2048 is sufficient and does
         not need to be changed.

Keyword: LocalAddress
Where:   LogFormat
Desc:    The local Internet address of the connection.

Keyword: LocalPort
Where:   LogFormat
Desc:    The port number of the server.

Keyword: Location
Where:   Control
Type:    String
Desc:    The Location keyword is used in combination with the Alias keyword.
         There are two types of locations: physical locations and 'redirects'.
         A physicial location is anything that starts with a slash ('/'),
         a redirect is anything else.
         When mathopd processes a request, the Alias that matches the
         Request-URI sent by the client is replaced with its corresponding
         location. For example, in the following situation

           Control {
             Alias /doc
             Location /usr/share/doc/handbook
           }

         when a client requests a URI '/doc/x11.html', the server will
         send the contents of /usr/share/doc/handbook/x11.html.
         When the location is a redirect, the server will send a HTTP
         '302' status response, which should cause the client to redirect
         to the desired location. Example:

           Control {
             Alias /secure
             Location https://an.example
           }

         In this example, when a client request a URI '/secure/test.html',
         the server will redirect the client to 'https://an.example/test.html'.

         More than one Location keywords can be used with one alias. Mathopd
         will rotate the locations on a round-robin bases. Example:

           Control {
             Alias /download
             Location http://mirror1.an.example/download
             Location http://mirror2.an.example/download
             Location http://mirror3.an.example/download
           }

         The first client that request something under /download will be
         redirected to mirrior1.an.example, the second client to mirror2,
         the third to mirror3, the fourth to mirror1, and so on.

         Wildcard expansion: the wildcard character '*' in Location values
         is expanded to the current value of the 'host' header sent by the
         client (after conversion to lower case.) This makes it possible to
         define a very large number of virtual servers in one go.
         Example:

           Server {
             Virtual {
               AnyHost
               Control {
                 Alias /
                 Location /home/www/*
               }
             }
           }

         With this setting, a request for, say, http://an.example/foo.html
         will result in the file /home/www/an.example/foo.html.

Keyword: Log
Where:   Global
Type:    String
Desc:    This keyword determines where the access log is stored. The
         server creates one and only one access log, regardless of the
         number of (virtual) servers. The log file must be writeable
         by the user the server runs as. If no log file exists, Mathopd
         will try to create one. In that case, the server must also have
         write access to the directory that will contain the log file.
         There are some hacks that make it easier to maintain logs
         for distinct time periods. Before Mathopd tries to open the
         log file, it will expand any '%' constructs in the log file
         name, similar to date(1) and strftime(3). For example, if

           Log /var/mathopd/log.%Y%m%d

         is used, Mathopd will expand the %Y, %m and %d in the file
         name, to something like /var/mathopd/log.20020831
         Mathopd automatically rotates the log file every hour.
         If during this process Mathopd cannot create a new log file
         for any reason, it will continue to append to the old log.
         The format of the access log is determined by whatever is
         specified in the LogFormat block (see below.)

Keyword: LogFormat
Where:   Global
Type:    Block
Desc:    This keyword determines the order in which items are written into
         the log file. Each line of the log file consists of some tab-
         separated fields. The contents of each field is determined by
         whatever is inside the LogFormat block. For example, if the
         following is specified

           LogFormat { CTime URI }

         the first field in the log file corresponds to the date and time
         of the request, and the second field corresponds to the client's
         request-URI at that time.

         The default field order for the log is as follows.

           Ctime
           RemoteUser
           RemoteAddress
           RemotePort
           ServerName
           Method
           Uri
           Status
           ContentLength
           Referer
           UserAgent
           BytesRead
           BytesWritten

         In addition to the above, the following fields are available:-

           LocalAddress
           LocalPort
           Version
           QueryString
           TimeTaken
           MicroTime

Keyword: LogGMT
Where:   Global
Type:    Flag
Default: Off
Desc:    Normally time stamps in log files are in local time. If
         LogGMT is set to 'On', time stamps are in GMT. Note that
         this setting also affects naming of log files when
         '%' constructions are used. (See the 'Log' keyword.)

Keyword: Method
Where:   LogFormat
Desc:    The client's request-method, usually GET.

Keyword: MicroTime
Where:   LogFormat
Desc:    The time, measured in seconds, with microsecond precision,
         since 00:00:00 UTC, January 1, 1970. (Or whatever is returned
         by the gettimeofday() system call.)

Keyword: NoHost
Where:   Virtual
Desc:    A Virtual server that has the "NoHost" keyword will be used when
         no Host header is sent by the client.

Keyword: NumConnections
Where:   Tuning
Type:    Integer
Default: 64
Desc:    The NumConnections parameter determines how many simultaneous
         requests can be handled.
         The default is probably too low for high-traffic systems.
         Mathopd uses a fixed block of memory for each connection, so
         the higher you set this tunable, the more memory the server
         will use.

         See also: Clobber.

         Note: the amount of memory that is used by Mathopd for buffers
         can be approximated by the formula

           Memory =
             NumConnections * (BufSize + InputBufSize + 2 * ScriptBufSize)

Keyword: NumHeaders
Where:   Tuning
Type:    Integer
Default: 100
Desc:    This keyword has a dual purpose.

         Mathopd keeps track of the HTTP headers that are sent by a client
         to pass on to child processes. Since each of these headers must
         be stored somewhere, a fixed amount of memory is set aside for
         these. The number of HTTP headers that are actually stored is
         determined by the value of NumHeaders. If a client sends more headers
         these will still be processed by the server, but they will not be
         available as environment variables.

         This keyword has an additional function: it determines the maximum
         number of headers that a CGI script can send. It is an error for
         a script to send more than this number of headers.

Keyword: NumProcesses
Where:   Tuning
Type:    Integer
Default: 1
Desc:    This keyword controls the number of processes that will be created.
         The idea is that this number can be set to the number of (logical)
         CPUs in a multi-processor system, in order to increase performance.

         If the value of NumProcesses is greater than one, the value recorded
         in the PIDfile is not a process ID, but a negative number, indicating
         the process group for all mathopd processes.

         Note: the value of NumProcesses will be ignored if the server is
         started with the '-n' flag.

Keyword: Options
Where:   Server
Desc:    The Options keyword sets so-called socket options for a particular
         server. The options currently defined are:

           Name: rcvbuf
           Type: integer
           This option sets the size of the kernel receive buffer for
           each connection on this server.

           Name: sndbuf
           Type: integer
           This option sets the size of the kernel send buffer for
           each connection on this server.

           Name: nodelay
           Type: flag
           This option, if set, disables the so-called Nagle algorithm
           for this server.

           Name: v6only
           Type: flag
           This option is valid only for inet6 servers. If the option
           is turned on the server will listen only for IPv6 connections.
           If the option is turned off the server will listen for IPv4
           connections as well. If the option is not set the behaviour may
           vary depending on the operating system.

         To illustrate how options are set, here is a short example

           Server {
             Family inet6
             Options {
               v6only On
             }
           }

Keyword: PID
Where:   LogFormat
Desc:    The identifier of the process that handled the request.

Keyword: PIDFile
Where:   Global
Type:    String
Desc:    The PIDFile keyword specifies a file in which the server will
         record its process ID, for tracking purposes. If more than one
         process is started, the negative of the process group is recorded.

Keyword: PathArgs
Where:   Control
Type:    Flag
Desc:    If you want to redirect a user to a different web site, regardless
         of the actual URL that is requested, you can do something like this

           Control {
             Alias /foo
             Location http://www.an.example/foo.html
             PathArgs On
           }

         In the above example, a request for, say, /foo/index.html will be
         redirected to http://www.an.example/foo.html. In fact, *any* request
         that starts with /foo/ will be redirected to the same URL. If the
         PathArgs were omitted a request for /foo/index.html would be
         redirected to http://www.an.example/foo.html/index.html (which does
         not make much sense of course.)

         The PathArgs keyword was originally created to solve a problem
         related to hit metering. If you have a website, but no control
         over its logfiles, you can create hidden images on your site
         that link to a statistics gathering site. This is a well-known
         process of course. If the statistics-gathering runs mathopd it
         can be set up something like this:-

           Control {
             Alias /
             Location /usr/local/www/tiny-image.png
             PathArgs On
           }

         This way, every request will return the same response, namely,
         the contents of tiny-image.png. If the two websites cooperate,
         the request-URI that appears in the log file on the gathering
         website can then be used to collect hit-metering data for the
         original site.

Keyword: PathInfo
Where:   Control
Type:    Flag
Default: On
Desc:    Normally mathopd allows requests for things like /script.cgi/args,
         where /args is passed as 'path info' to the script.cgi program. This
         works by mathopd chopping off all trailing path components until a
         file is found. This operation can be quite expensive and in most
         circumstances it is not needed. Worse yet, a request for, say,
         /a/b/c/d/e/f/g/h will result in eight system calls.

         To turn the 'chopping' behaviour off, set the value of PathInfo to
         Off.

         Note that PathInfo defaults to On for backwards compatibility.

Keyword: Port
Where:   Server
Type:    Integer
Default: 80
Desc:    If you want Mathopd to run a server on a different port, rather
         than the default for http, which is port 80, use a Port declaration.
         Example:

           Server {
             Port 8080
           }

Keyword: PutEnv
Where:   Control
Type:    Block
Desc:    This is like Export, except that environment variables defined
         here must accompanied by a value.
         Example: (rather silly)

           Control {
             PutEnv {
               MATHOPD_INVOKED=1
             }
           }

         There must be no space between the name of an environment
         variable, the equals sign, and its value. If the value contains
         space characters the entire name=value bit must be enclosed in
         double quotes.

Keyword: QueryString
Where:   LogFormat
Desc:    The query string (the part that follows the '?' in the request-URI)
         if present.

Keyword: Realm
Where:   Control
Type:    String
Desc:    If this keyword is present in a control block, resources in that
         block are protected using username-password combinations. The
         Realm keyword must be accompanied by a UserFile keyword. The
         value of the Realm keyword is transmitted to the client in '401'
         error responses. Its value may be displayed by a web browser in
         a login dialog.

Keyword: Referer
Where:   LogFormat
Desc:    The value of the 'Referer:' header sent by the client. Sometimes
         this refers to a URL that contains a link to the current request.

Keyword: RemoteAddress
Where:   LogFormat
Desc:    The Internet Address of the client.

Keyword: RemotePort
Where:   LogFormat
Desc:    The port number at the client's end of its connection to the server.

Keyword: RemoteUser
Where:   LogFormat
Desc:    The username sent by the client for a request that needs
         authorization and has successfully authenticated.

Keyword: RootDirectory
Where:   Global
Type:    String
Desc:    If this keyword is present, mathopd will perform a chroot() to the
         specified directory before startup. The chroot() is done right
         after the configuration file is read. Obviously the server must
         be started as root for this to work. Some additional files may be
         required in the new root, like a (stripped down) /etc/passwd and
         so on.

Keyword: RunScriptsAsOwner
Where:   Control
Type:    Flag
Default: Off
Desc:    Normally, if the server is started as root and the StayRoot flag
         is set, child processes are run as a certain user (see the StayRoot
         and ScriptUser keywords.)
         It is possible to run CGI scripts as the user that owns them by
         setting the RunScriptsAsOwner flag.
         This is not recommended, since it is possible to trick mathopd
         using symbolic links.

Keyword: SanitizePath
Where:   Control
Type:    Flag
Default: Off
Desc:    If this flag is set for a virtual server, Mathop will filter out
         all '//', '/./' and '/../' components of a URL.
         For example, a request for

             /foo/bar/../baz/./watnou//weer

         would be treated as if it really had been for

             /foo/baz/watnou/weer

         Note that the presense of this flag in a virtual directory has no
         effect. It only works at server level.

         Also note that URLs of the form

             /some/dir/.
             /some/dir/..

         that is, URLs that end with /. or /.. are illegal and return an
         error, irrespective of the SanitizePath setting.

Keyword: ScriptBufSize
Where:   Tuning
Type:    Integer
Default: 4096
Desc:    The server uses two buffers for CGI scripts: one for data that
         is passed to a script, and another for data arriving from a script.
         It is recommended that ScriptBufSize be equal to or greater than
         InputBufSize. Also the ScriptBufSize should be at least sixteen
         bytes less than BufSize, to leave room in the output buffer for
         'chunk' delimiters.

Keyword: ScriptTimeout
Where:   Tuning
Type:    Integer
Default: 60
Desc:    This timeout determines how long, measured in seconds, scripts
         can run without generating any output.

Keyword: ScriptUser
Where:   Control
Type:    String
Desc:    If a CGI or external program is executed, Mathopd will change
         its identity to make sure that such programs cannot do silly
         things like kill the web server process and so on. The recommended
         way to set the user for child processes is with the ScriptUser
         keyword. Its argument is a user name that will be looked up in
         the system password file right before execution of each program.
         The user specified by ScriptUser must be someone else than the
         'global' user, i.e. the user specified by the User keyword.
         Note that in order to get CGI to work if mathopd is started by
         root, the StayRoot flag MUST be set to 'On'.
         See also: StayRoot.

Keyword: Server
Where:   Global
Type:    Block
Desc:    The Server keyword sets up a physical server, that is, a TCP
         socket. Some TCP parameters may be tuned (see Address and Port.)
         Inside a server block one can then declare 'virtual' servers,
         which is where all action occurs.

Keyword: ServerName
Where:   LogFormat
Desc:    The value of the 'Host:' header sent by the client (more or less.)

Keyword: Specials
Where:   Control
Type:    Block
Desc:    Some file extensions can be treated specially if they are
         put into a 'Specials' block. There are four specialties:

           CGI
           Imagemap
           Redirect
           Dump

         If a specialty is defined with a name that is not one of the
         above four, a file that matches that specialty is treated as
         if it did not exist. (See the 'Dummy' example in the description
         of the ExactMatch keyword.)

         A very brief description of the four specialties follows.

         For a description of CGI, see cgi.txt.
         An imagemap is a fairly ancient concept. It is generally not
         used anymore but it is kept around for historical reasons.
         A redirect file simply redirects the client to a URL that is
         contained in the file. A Dump displays some mildly interesting
         server statistics but is otherwise not very useful.

         Example:

           Control {
             Specials {
               CGI { cgi }
               Imagemap { map }
             }
           }

Keyword: Status
Where:   LogFormat
Desc:    The three-digit HTTP status code for this request.

Keyword: StayRoot
Where:   Global
Type:    Flag
Default: Off
Desc:    Mathopd, if it is started by root, will change its identity to
         that of a nonprivileged user (see the User keyword.) It is
         sometimes desirable to retain some root privileges, for example
         when external processes are started. One does not really want
         those child processes to be able to interfere with the server
         process itself, therefore these processes must be run under a
         different identity. In order to accomplish this, set the
         StayRoot flag.

Keyword: Timeout
Where:   Tuning
Type:    Integer
Default: 60
Desc:    Connections that are idle for too long are aborted by Mathopd.
         Idle in this case meaning 'receiving or transmitting no data.'
         It is possible to increase or decrease the timeout by adding
         a Timeout keyword. The unit of the timeout value is seconds.

         See also: ScriptTimeout and Wait.

Keyword: TimeTaken
Where:   LogFormat
Desc:    The time it has taken for the request to complete. Time is
         measured from the first meaningful byte received from the client,
         or the time the client connected.

Keyword: Tuning
Where:   Global
Type:    Block
Desc:    Some items that control general tuning of the server can be
         specified here.

Keyword: Types
Where:   Control
Type:    Block
Desc:    All served content must be accompanied by a 'Content-Type' header
         that indicates the kind of content. Historically, HTTP servers
         have used the extension of a filename to determine its content.
         For example a file whose name ends with 'html' is likely to
         contain HTML, a file with a name ending with 'png' is probably
         a PNG image, and so on. Mathopd follows this behaviour. File
         extensions are mapped to media types (values of 'Content-Type'
         that web browsers understand) using the 'Types' keyword.
         Example:

           Control {
             Types {
               text/html { html htm }
               text/plain { txt }
               image/jpeg { jpg }
               application/octet-stream { * }
             }
           }

         As you can see, the media type is followed by a group of
         extensions that will be mapped to that type. The special
         extension '*' is used to indicate a default: if a filename has
         an extension that does not occur in any of the Types (or Specials
         or External), then the type for '*' (if it is defined) is used.

         Note that for Mathopd, 'extension' really means just `last part'.
         For example, a file that is called 'flubrdhtml' is deemed to
         be a HTML file even though it does not really have an extension.
         This is a bit of a misfeature, but it does no real harm in
         practice.

Keyword: Umask
Where:   Global
Type:    Integer
Default: 022
Desc:    Mathopd will create log files with certain permissions. These
         permissions are determined by what is called in Unix lingo the
         'umask'. A umask of 022 (the default) will create files that are
         readable by everyone but writeable only by the user that runs the
         server process. More restricted umasks are 026 or even 066.
         (The 0 at the beginning is not optional!)

         Note: the umask is inherited by child processes.

Keyword: Uri
Where:   LogFormat
Desc:    The URI requested by the client (minus query string, if present.)

Keyword: User
Where:   Global
Type:    String
Desc:    If Mathopd is started by root it must change its identity. This
         is done for security reasons: you do not want the web server to
         be able to read all files. The new identity is defined by the
         value of the User keyword. The user name is looked up in the
         password file (this is done before a possible chroot!) and
         Mathopd then changes its effective user id (and real user id
         as well, depending on whether StayRoot is off or on). In addition,
         Mathopd will perform a setgroups() call to clear its list of
         supplementary group ids.

         Note: Mathopd will create log files, etc. with an owner that is
         equal to the value of the User keyword. The *group* owner of
         the log file may differ between operating systems. For example,
         on BSD, the group owner of a file is set to the group owner of
         the directory in which it is created. Other systems may have
         different semantics.

Keyword: UserAgent
Where:   LogFormat
Desc:    The value of the 'User-Agent:' header sent by the client. This may,
         or may not, contain a string that can identify a web browser.

Keyword: UserDirectory
Where:   Control
Type:    Flag
Desc:    To allow each user to put up his or her personal pages, use the
         UserDirectory kyeword.
         Example:

           Control {
             Alias /users
             Location public_html
             UserDirectory On
           }

         In this example, a request for /users/boland/index.html will
         result in a password lookup for user 'boland'. Assume the home
         directory for this user is /home/boland. Then the file served will
         be /home/boland/public_html/index.html.

         Note: the '~' character, when used as the last character in
         an alias is treated specially. For example:

           Control {
             Alias /~
             Location public_html
             UserDirectory On
           }

         With this setting, /~boland/index.html will be mapped to
         /home/boland/public_html/index.html, like before. This is to
         allow some sort of compatibilty to the often used custom to use
         '~username' for user pages.

         If a user does not exist, the control block that contains the
         UserDirectory item is effectively ignored.

Keyword: UserFile
Where:   Control
Type:    String
Desc:    Control blocks that are 'protected' by a Realm keyword need
         a UserFile keyword as well. The user file contains all username /
         password combinations that are valid for that specific realm.
         The user file should contain lines that look like

           username:password

         (with username and password replaced by a real username and
         password of course.) A user can be entered more than once with
         different passwords. The user file has no relation whatsoever
         to the system password file. Passwords can be encrypted, but
         Mathopd needs to be told that they are encrypted, using the
         EncryptedUserFile keyword.

Keyword: Version
Where:   LogFormat
Desc:    The HTTP version requested by the client.

Keyword: Virtual
Where:   Server, Global
Type:    Block
Desc:    The 'Virtual' keyword starts a virtual server block.
         Virtual blocks can be declared globally or inside a server block.
         Global virtual blocks are inherited by all servers that follow.

Keyword: Wait
Where:   Tuning
Type:    Integer
Default: 60
Desc:    The value of 'Wait' represents the amount of time, in seconds,
         the server will wait for a request from the client.
