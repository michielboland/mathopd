Changes between Mathopd 1.5 and Mathopd 1.6

The '*' character in Error*File and AutoIndexCommand is
replaced with the current value of the Host header.

If the Error*File is not present, the original HTTP status code
is sent back, rather than a 500 error.

IPv6 support has been added. It is not clear yet how the Access
and Clients functionality should be ported. Therefore Access and
Clients has been temporarily disabled, as well as Error403File.

The server can now fork multiple copies of itself, via the
NumProcesses keyword.

Mathopd can now (optionally) allow //, /./ and /../ in URL
paths. Thanks for Peter Pentchev for suggesting this and providing
initial patches.

Attempts have been made to add support for large (>2GB) files on
32-bit operating systems. FreeBSD, Linux and Solaris
have been tested so far.

The following keywords have been added:

	ExpireInterval
	Family
	Options
	NumProcesses
	PID
	SanitizePath

The following keywords have been removed:

	Access
	Allow
	Apply
	Clients
	Deny
	NoApply
